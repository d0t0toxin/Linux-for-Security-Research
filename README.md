# Linux for Security Research 🛡️🐧

A comprehensive guide to mastering the Linux command line, system architecture, and networking for **ethical hacking** and **web security research**.

---

## Overview
This repository is a practical guide for anyone stepping into **Cybersecurity**, **Ethical Hacking**, or **Web Security Research**. While many tools have GUIs, the true power of security work lies in the Linux terminal. Here, you’ll learn the commands, workflows, and concepts that underpin professional security research.

## Why Linux?
Linux is the industry standard for security work because:

* **Transparency:** Inspect every process, file, and system behavior.
* **Automation:** Automate tasks, reconnaissance, and exploitation with Bash scripting.
* **Compatibility:** Most security tools (Nmap, Burp Suite, Metasploit) are native to or optimized for Linux.

## 🛠️ Command Categories Covered
1. **File & Directory Management:** Navigate the system, manage files, and permissions.
2. **Text Processing & Logs:** Use `grep`, `awk`, and `sed` to analyze data and detect issues.
3. **Networking & Connectivity:** Explore ports, protocols, and active connections.
4. **Privilege Escalation:** Learn techniques for safely elevating user access.
5. **System Auditing & Monitoring:** Track processes, logs, and system performance.
6. **Advanced Topics:** Kernel internals, virtualization, containers, and security auditing.

## 🚀 Getting Started
If you’re new to Linux:

1. Start with the `Fundamentals/` directory.
2. Practice in a virtual environment such as **Kali Linux** or **Parrot OS** to safely experiment without affecting your main system.
3. Follow the examples and try modifying commands to see how Linux behaves.
