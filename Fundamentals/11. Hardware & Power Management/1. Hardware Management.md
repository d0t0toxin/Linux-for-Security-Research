# lsmod Command in Linux

## Introduction

The lsmod command in Linux is used to display the status of kernel modules currently loaded into the running kernel. Kernel modules are pieces of code that extend the functionality of the Linux kernel at runtime without requiring a system reboot. Examples include device drivers, filesystem support, and network protocol handlers.

The lsmod command is essential for system administrators and advanced users who need to inspect kernel behavior, troubleshoot hardware or driver issues, and understand module dependencies.

* * *

## What lsmod Does

lsmod reads information from the Linux kernel and displays a list of all loaded kernel modules along with their memory usage and dependency relationships. It provides insight into which modules are active and how they interact with each other.

The information shown by lsmod is derived from the file located at /proc/modules.

* * *

## Basic Usage

To display all currently loaded kernel modules, run:

```bash
lsmod
```

Example output

```text
Module                  Size  Used by
snd_hda_intel          53248  3
snd_hda_codec         163840  1 snd_hda_intel
snd_pcm               114688  2 snd_hda_intel,snd_hda_codec
```

Each row represents one kernel module loaded into memory.

* * *

## Understanding the Output Columns

### Module

The name of the kernel module. This name usually corresponds to a driver or kernel feature.

### Size

The amount of memory in bytes that the module occupies in kernel space.

### Used by

Indicates how many other modules or kernel components are currently using this module. If dependent modules exist, their names are also shown.

* * *

## Module Dependencies

Kernel modules often depend on other modules to function correctly. The Used by column helps identify these relationships.

Example

```text
snd_pcm 114688 2 snd_hda_intel,snd_hda_codec
```

This means the snd_pcm module is used by two other modules named snd_hda_intel and snd_hda_codec.

* * *

## Filtering lsmod Output

To search for a specific module, lsmod output is commonly filtered using grep.

Example

```bash
lsmod | grep usb
```

This command shows only modules related to USB functionality.

* * *

## Common Use Cases

### Check if a Driver Is Loaded

```bash
lsmod | grep e1000e
```

This verifies whether the Intel e1000e network driver is currently loaded.

### Identify Graphics Driver Modules

```bash
lsmod | grep drm
```

This helps confirm whether Direct Rendering Manager related modules are active.

### Inspect Filesystem Modules

```bash
lsmod | grep ext4
```

This confirms whether the ext4 filesystem module is loaded.

* * *

## lsmod and modprobe

lsmod is often used together with modprobe for module management.

lsmod displays which modules are loaded.  
modprobe loads or unloads kernel modules and resolves dependencies automatically.

Example

```bash
sudo modprobe vfat
lsmod | grep vfat
```

* * *

## lsmod and rmmod

The rmmod command removes a loaded kernel module. Before removing a module, lsmod is used to ensure the module is not actively used.

Example

```bash
lsmod | grep vfat
sudo rmmod vfat
```

If a module is in use, the kernel will prevent its removal.

* * *

## lsmod vs modinfo

lsmod shows only currently loaded modules.  
modinfo displays detailed information about a specific module, whether it is loaded or not.

Example

```bash
modinfo snd_hda_intel
```

* * *

## Relationship with /proc/modules

The lsmod command is a formatted view of the contents of the following file:

```text
/proc/modules
```

Advanced users can inspect this file directly, but lsmod provides a clearer and safer presentation.

* * *

## Practical Troubleshooting Scenarios

### Debug Missing Hardware Support

If a device is not working, lsmod can confirm whether the required driver module is loaded.

### Detect Conflicting Modules

Multiple drivers attempting to control the same hardware can cause issues. lsmod helps identify such conflicts.

### Validate Automatic Module Loading

When hardware is connected, the kernel may auto load modules. lsmod verifies whether this process succeeded.

* * *

## Limitations

- lsmod only shows modules currently loaded
    
- It does not load or remove modules
    
- Root privileges are not required to view modules, but are required to manage them
    

* * *

## Summary

The lsmod command is a fundamental Linux utility for inspecting loaded kernel modules. It provides clear visibility into kernel extensions, memory usage, and module dependencies. Understanding lsmod is critical for effective driver management, kernel troubleshooting, and system stability.

lsipc is a modern replacement for the older ipcs command.

lsipc provides better formatting filtering and column selection.  
ipcs is still available but is considered legacy.

* * *

## Practical Use Cases

Monitor shared memory usage on database servers.  
Detect orphaned IPC objects left by crashed applications.  
Verify IPC resource limits during application deployment.  
Audit ownership and permissions of IPC resources.

* * *

## Cleaning Up IPC Resources

lsipc only displays information. To remove IPC objects use the ipcrm command.

Example

```bash
ipcrm -m 0
```

This removes a shared memory segment with the specified ID.

* * *

## Relationship with proc and sysctl

IPC information is managed by the kernel and exposed through proc and sysctl interfaces.

Example paths include

```text
/proc/sys/kernel/shmmni
/proc/sys/kernel/sem
```

lsipc presents this information in a consolidated and readable form.

* * *

## Limitations

lsipc only reports System V IPC mechanisms.  
It does not display POSIX shared memory or POSIX message queues.  
Root privileges may be required for complete visibility on some systems.

* * *

## Summary

The lsipc command is a powerful inspection tool for System V interprocess communication resources in Linux. It provides clear visibility into shared memory segments message queues and semaphores along with their usage and limits. Mastering lsipc is important for debugging IPC related issues system tuning and maintaining application stability.
