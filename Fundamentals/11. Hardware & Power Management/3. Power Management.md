# `Poweroff` Command in Linux

## Overview

The `poweroff` command in Linux is used to shut down the system immediately. It safely terminates all processes and powers off the machine. This command requires superuser privileges.

## Syntax

```
poweroff [options]
```

## Options

- `-f` : Force immediate shutdown without contacting the init system. This can be useful if the system is unresponsive.
    
- `-i` : Shuts down the system and turns off power only for systems that support it.
    
- `--help` : Display help information about the command.
    
- `--halt` : Halt the system but do not turn off power.
    

## Examples

1.  **Basic Shutdown**

```
sudo poweroff
```

This command will safely terminate all running processes and power off the system.

2.  **Force Shutdown**

```
sudo poweroff -f
```

This forces an immediate shutdown, bypassing the usual shutdown procedures. Use with caution.

3.  **Halt Without Powering Off**

```
sudo poweroff --halt
```

This will stop all processes and halt the system, but it will not turn off the power.

4.  **Help Option**

```
poweroff --help
```

Displays all available options and usage information.

## Notes

- Always save your work before executing the `poweroff` command to avoid data loss.
    
- Use `sudo` if you are not logged in as the root user.
    
- On some systems, `shutdown -h now` can be used as an alternative to `poweroff`.

# `Reboot` Command in Linux

## Overview

The `reboot` command in Linux is used to restart the system immediately. It terminates all processes safely, unmounts file systems, and then reboots the machine. This command requires superuser privileges.

## Syntax

```
reboot [options]
```

## Options

- `-f` : Force an immediate reboot without contacting the init system. Useful if the system is unresponsive.
    
- `-p` : Power off the system instead of rebooting.
    
- `--help` : Display help information about the command.
    
- `--reboot` : Explicitly trigger a reboot.
    

## Examples

1.  **Basic Reboot**

```
sudo reboot
```

This safely terminates all running processes and reboots the system.

2.  **Force Reboot**

```
sudo reboot -f
```

This forces an immediate reboot, bypassing the usual shutdown procedures. Use with caution.

3.  **Power Off Instead of Reboot**

```
sudo reboot -p
```

This shuts down the system completely instead of rebooting.

4.  **Help Option**

```
reboot --help
```

Displays all available options and usage information.

## Notes

- Always save your work before executing the `reboot` command to avoid data loss.
    
- Use `sudo` if you are not logged in as the root user.
    
- On some systems, `shutdown -r now` can be used as an alternative to `reboot`.

# `Shutdown` Command in Linux

## Overview

The `shutdown` command in Linux is used to bring the system down in a secure way. It terminates all running processes, unmounts file systems, and powers off or reboots the system depending on the options provided. This command requires superuser privileges.

## Syntax

```
shutdown [OPTION] [TIME] [MESSAGE]
```

## Options

- `-h` : Halt the system after shutdown. The system will not restart.
    
- `-r` : Reboot the system after shutdown.
    
- `-P` : Power off the system after shutdown.
    
- `-c` : Cancel a scheduled shutdown.
    
- `--help` : Display help information about the command.
    

## Time Format

- `now` : Shutdown immediately.
    
- `+m` : Shutdown after m minutes.
    
- `hh:mm` : Shutdown at specified time in 24-hour format.
    

## Examples

1.  **Shutdown Immediately**

```
sudo shutdown now
```

This command shuts down the system immediately.

2.  **Reboot the System**

```
sudo shutdown -r now
```

This will restart the system immediately.

3.  **Schedule Shutdown in 10 Minutes**

```
sudo shutdown +10
```

This schedules the system to shut down after 10 minutes.

4.  **Schedule Shutdown at Specific Time**

```
sudo shutdown 22:30
```

This schedules the system to shut down at 10:30 PM.

5.  **Cancel Scheduled Shutdown**

```
sudo shutdown -c
```

This cancels any previously scheduled shutdown.

6.  **Shutdown with Custom Message**

```
sudo shutdown +5 "System maintenance, please save your work"
```

This schedules a shutdown in 5 minutes and notifies all logged-in users with a custom message.

## Notes

- Always save your work before executing the shutdown command to avoid data loss.
    
- Use `sudo` if you are not logged in as the root user.
    
- The `shutdown` command provides more flexibility than `poweroff` or `reboot` for scheduling and messaging.

# `Halt` Command in Linux

## Overview

The `halt` command in Linux is used to stop all CPU functions, effectively bringing the system to a halt. It safely terminates all processes and unmounts file systems. Unlike `poweroff`, it does not always turn off the power, depending on the system configuration. Superuser privileges are required to execute this command.

## Syntax

```
halt [options]
```

## Options

- `-f` : Force halt without contacting the init system. Useful if the system is unresponsive.
    
- `-p` : Power off the machine after halting.
    
- `--help` : Display help information about the command.
    
- `--no-wall` : Do not send a warning message to all logged-in users.
    

## Examples

1.  **Basic Halt**

```
sudo halt
```

This safely stops all processes and halts the system.

2.  **Force Halt**

```
sudo halt -f
```

Forces the system to halt immediately without notifying the init system.

3.  **Halt and Power Off**

```
sudo halt -p
```

Halts the system and then powers it off.

4.  **Halt Without Warning Users**

```
sudo halt --no-wall
```

Halts the system without sending a warning message to logged-in users.

## Notes

- Always save your work before executing the `halt` command to prevent data loss.
    
- Use `sudo` if you are not logged in as the root user.
    
- `halt` is different from `poweroff` and `shutdown` in that it may not turn off the power unless explicitly specified with the `-p` option.
    
- On many modern Linux distributions, `halt`, `poweroff`, and `reboot` are symbolic links to `systemctl` commands.

# `loginctl Poweroff` and `Reboot` Commands in Linux

## Overview

The `loginctl` command is part of systemd and is used to introspect and control the system login manager. It provides functionality to power off or reboot the system safely, affecting all user sessions. These commands require superuser privileges.

## Syntax

```
loginctl poweroff [options]
loginctl reboot [options]
```

## loginctl Poweroff

### Description

The `loginctl poweroff` command instructs the system to safely terminate all user sessions and power off the machine.

### Options

- `--force` : Force immediate power off without waiting for sessions to terminate.
    
- `--no-wall` : Do not send warning messages to logged-in users.
    
- `--help` : Display help information about the command.
    

### Examples

1.  **Basic Poweroff**

```
sudo loginctl poweroff
```

This safely powers off the system, terminating all sessions.

2.  **Force Poweroff**

```
sudo loginctl poweroff --force
```

This immediately powers off the system without waiting for user sessions to end.

3.  **Poweroff Without Warning Users**

```
sudo loginctl poweroff --no-wall
```

This powers off the system without notifying logged-in users.

## loginctl Reboot

### Description

The `loginctl reboot` command safely restarts the system, affecting all user sessions.

### Options

- `--force` : Force immediate reboot without waiting for sessions to terminate.
    
- `--no-wall` : Do not send warning messages to logged-in users.
    
- `--help` : Display help information about the command.
    

### Examples

1.  **Basic Reboot**

```
sudo loginctl reboot
```

This safely reboots the system, terminating all user sessions.

2.  **Force Reboot**

```
sudo loginctl reboot --force
```

This immediately reboots the system without waiting for sessions to end.

3.  **Reboot Without Warning Users**

```
sudo loginctl reboot --no-wall
```

This reboots the system without notifying logged-in users.

## Notes

- Always save your work before executing these commands to avoid data loss.
    
- `loginctl poweroff` and `loginctl reboot` provide a systemd-native method to control system power, which may be preferred on modern Linux distributions.
    
- These commands are equivalent to `systemctl poweroff` and `systemctl reboot` in functionality.
